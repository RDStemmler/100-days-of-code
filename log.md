# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: April 24, 2019


**Today's Progress**: Committed to the 100 Days of Code, including my first tweet.

**Thoughts:** I'm kind of nervous about this project, although I don't really know why. I've been coding for a while, so it's not like I'm in over my head. But I also haven't been coding regularly like I should. So I'll be using this opportunity to not only get into the regular daily practice of coding but also to start getting involved in some things I've never done (such as reading code a la Nemil Dalal's excellent article on reading code). Anyway, I'm just going to dive right in with some practice tuts, starting with the EnvatoTut Parallax scrolling effect (tinyurl.com/y207qglh). That won't take an hour so I'll use the leftover time in my hour to work on the battleship game in Chapter Two of theHeadfirst JS book.



### Day 1: April 25, 2019


**Today's Progress**: Made a Battleship Game

**Thoughts**: I first worked with the Battleship game when Headfirst covered it in Chapter Two. But I finally built a version of it, utilizing HTML, CSS and JS. It's pretty basic, but a good way to use the first day of 100 DoC to get warmed up. It was also my first real foray into JS. On Day Two, I'll try reading my code before I move on to my new project. That new project will be a snake game (keeping with the game theme for a while).

I found the experience of actually building the game interesting. First, because I slipped into the HTML and CSS much smoother than I usually do, so maybe I'm starting to get the hang of it. But since I was pretty much transcribing the JS from my notes, I found that I was able to work through the code when I got stuck. And that was a big surprise. It was a good day, and a nice confidence-building start to this project.

### Day 1: June 27, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
