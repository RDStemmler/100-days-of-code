# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: April 24, 2019


**Today's Progress**: Committed to the 100 Days of Code, including my first tweet.

**Thoughts:** I'm kind of nervous about this project, although I don't really know why. I've been coding for a while, so it's not like I'm in over my head. But I also haven't been coding regularly like I should. So I'll be using this opportunity to not only get into the regular daily practice of coding but also to start getting involved in some things I've never done (such as reading code a la Nemil Dalal's excellent article on reading code). Anyway, I'm just going to dive right in with some practice tuts, starting with the EnvatoTut Parallax scrolling effect (tinyurl.com/y207qglh). That won't take an hour so I'll use the leftover time in my hour to work on the battleship game in Chapter Two of theHeadfirst JS book.

### Day 0: February 30, 2016 (Example 2)
##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts**: I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 1: June 27, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
